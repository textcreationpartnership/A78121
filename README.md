#To the Kings most Excellent Maiesty, and the Honourable Court of Parliament The humble petition of many his Maiesties loyall and faithfull subiects, some of which having beene miserably persecuted by the prelates and their adherents, by all rigorous courses, for their consciences, practising nothing but what was instituted by the Lord Jesus Christ, who was Lord of all administrations, Math. 28. 19. and practised by the primitive Christians; submitting to his Maiestie and his lawes, so farre as concernes our estates, libertie, and lives; and so, as we conceive, give to Cæsar the things that are Cæsars, and to God those things that are his.#
